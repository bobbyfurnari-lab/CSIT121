    <h2>How is KeyboardEvent.code used?</h2>

    <p>
      KeyboardEvent.code is accessed through JavaScript keyboard event listeners within a browser. The browser automatically creates a KeyboardEvent 
      object every time a key is pressed, which is where the code property comes from. The code value returns standardized string labels for physical keys, 
      like "KeyA", "Enter", or "Space". These values stay the same even when the user switches keyboard language or layout, making them dependable. 
      This is why developers use event.code when they care about the real key pressed, not the symbol it types.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the main uses for KeyboardEvent.code is building keyboard controls in browser games and shortcuts. Keys like WASD and arrow buttons are detected
      based on their physical position. It is also used for keyboard shortcuts such as "Alt + Tab". It will work on any keyboard due to the physical location of the key.
    </p>

    <p>
      KeyboardEvent.code is best when websites need to know the physical key pressed instead of what letter it types. Since the codes stay the same across keyboard layouts and languages, 
      developers use it to avoid broken controls or shortcuts. Overall, it keeps keyboard logic more reliable and easier to test in the browser.
