      <h2>Why Is KeyboardEvent.code Important?</h2>

      <p>
        It is important for consistency across keyboards as many people use different keyboard layouts. KeyboardEvent.code allows for the standardization
        across these different keyboards such as QWERTY or AZERTY keyboards. Due to the physical position of the key being tied to the code value the same
        key means the same code. Without this standardization, different browsers could call the same physical key somthing different.
      </p>

      <p>
        This standard also applys for accessibility, as almost all users depend on clear controls when operating a keyboard. Some users could only be using a keyboard
        to navigate a website, esecially people with certian disabilites. KeyboardEvent.code allows for the creation of these reliable and clear keyboard controls that
        we have been using. When keyboard input is predicatable it becomes much easier to understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        For developers, having a standard list of codes makes writing much simpler. Before there was a standard, properties behaved differently between browers.
        Now, code is easier to read and keep intact when working on projects. Code is also easier and faster to share when working on a team. Overall, it allows for less
        time to be spent on keyboard errors and more time be spent on work.
