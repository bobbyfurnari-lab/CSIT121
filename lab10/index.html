      <h2>What Is KeyboardEvent.code?</h2>
        <p>
        KeyboardEvent.code is a code attribute that uses the physical button location on a keyboard. It is ran through keyboard events like keyup and keydown,
        which then scripts can use for when a user presses a key. Coming from the official W3C code list, the values are formatted as strings such as "Space" or "Enter".
        It tracks the physical key itself and keeps it consistent across all types of browsers and devices.
        </p>

        <p>
        KeyboardEvent.code defines and slipts the keyboard into sections and rows so each group of key has its own naming pattern. Regular lettered keys start with "Key" followed by a letter,
        the top row of the keyboard starts with "Digit" followed by a number, and arrow controls return names such as "ArrowUp". What is to note is that names describe the acutal buttons position
        on a keyboard. Describing the letter or symbol shown when typed is a different property labeled KeyboardEvent.key.
        </p>

        <p>
        The standard provided by W3C allows for an official list of names for physical keyboard shortcuts. The standard provides one shared set of identifiers everyone can use. It also includes
        codes for all types of keys that are always written as strings. Overall, it keeps keyboard input organized and universal for both developers and users.
