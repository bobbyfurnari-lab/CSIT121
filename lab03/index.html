            <p>
                This is my very first blog page that shows what I have learned so far in CSIT121. In this blog you will find
                how I was able to use a header, a footer, and articles to correctly structure my blog. Although with some difficult,
                I was also able to incorporate lists and external links below.
            </p>
            <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>How to use an article</li>
                    <li>How to use an ordered/unordered list</li>
                    <li>How to use a footer correctly</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                Learning how to incorporate an external link was cool, I can even show you the site below that helped me
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <nav>
                                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">WSSchools</a>
                            </nav>
                        </li>

                <h2>Lab 03 Reflection</h2>
                <p class="highlight-box">
                    This is my reflection for Lab 03, as I was able to decorate and add my own style of this page. Using the examples
                    given to us I was able to personally customize different CSS properties on the page to my own chosing. I was able
                    to make this page my favorite color, purple, and add one ID and class selector.
