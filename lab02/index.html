                This is my very first blog page that shows what I have learned so far in CSIT121. In this blog you will find
                how I was able to use a header, a footer, and articles to correctly structure my blog. Although with some difficult,
                I was also able to incorporate lists and external links below.

                Learning how to incorporate an external link was cool, I can even show you the site below that helped me
