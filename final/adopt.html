      <h2>Adopt a Friend</h2>
      <p>
        When you adopt from Pawsome Animal Shelter, you help save lives and give animals a second chance.
        Our team will work with you personally to help find a friend that fits your home, schedule, lifestyle, and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step in the adoption process requires completing an adoption application. You will then meet the pet in person
        and speak with a staff member about your expectations and daily routine.

          <h3>Lucky | 4-Year-Old Goldendoodle</h3>
          <p>
            Lucky is a friendly but timid, medium-energy dog who loves walks and chewing on bones. She does well with small children
            and calm dogs. Lucky is looking for a family who can give her plenty of attention, love, and daily exercise.

          <h3>Smudge | 2-Year-Old Tabby Cat</h3>
          <p>
            Smudge is a gentle tabby who enjoys chasing toys and quiet naps. He warms up slowly but becomes very
            affectionate once he feels safe. Smudge would be a great match for a calm home that can give him playtime and attention.
