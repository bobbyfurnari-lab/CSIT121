      <h2>About Pawsome Animal Shelter</h2>
      <p>
        Pawsome Animal Shelter is a local rescue group that focuses on helping abandoned and stray animals.
        Our goal is to give each animal a safe place to stay, proper care, and a chance to be adopted into
        a loving home. We work with dogs, cats, and small animals who need temporary support.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Along with daily care, we also offer adoption events, youth outreach, volunteer opportunities,
        and low-cost clinics for pet owners in the community. Everything we do is centered around
        promoting responsible pet care and connecting families with pets who match their lifestyle.

      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        Our shelter is run by a mix of staff and volunteers who handle daily animal care, cleaning,
        customer support, and event planning. Each person plays a role in helping the animals feel
        safe while they wait for a permanent home.

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

      <p>
        The most challenging part of this project for me was keeping the design consistent across all four pages. 
        I had to pay attention to small details like headings, spacing, and colors so the site looked like each page belonged together. However, I did feel successful in integrating and repositioning my images, including my hero image. 
        Testing the site on different devices also taught me how much a layout can shift depending on a phone’s smaller screen size. Some sections of my page looked fine on a laptop but needed adjustments on a phone, 
        so using a media query helped make the pages more responsive and easier to view on smaller screens.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, this course taught me the basic skills needed to build and style a website for myself or others. I learned the true functions of HTML and CSS while also managing to create multiple pages on my own. I also learned the importance of accessibility, alt text, 
        and validation for a user-friendly site. By the end of my project, I feel more confident in creating future webpages, 
        and I believe I now have the ability to design something that is consistent and easy to navigate.
