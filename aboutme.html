            <p>
                My name is Bobby Furnari and I am currently working on developing my skills in creating a website. I am a big animal lover
                and I have one cat named Smudge. In my free time I like to hang out with friends or play video games and rugby.

                I used to play rugby in highschool, but now occasionally play with my friends. If I'm not hanging out with my firends then
                you can find me playing all sorts of games on my Xbox or Nintendo Switch.
